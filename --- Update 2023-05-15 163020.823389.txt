Active Package(s):


FOR STEPS 2 - 4, info is in `show running-config`

2. check `show running-config` if 1 or more acl are configured with log option inside an ACE (entry) in the ACL. Store the  ACL name for step 3. 

The ACL format will be like:
<sequence number> permit <source and dest info string> log <options string, optional but there may be more options here potentially>


ip access-list BDN-LAYER3-DENIED-BY-VACL
  10 remark *note* the permits will actually cause denials because it's applied to a drop policy in the VACL
  20 remark KILL INTRA-VLAN TRAFFIC BY LAYER 3 ATTRIBUTES
  30 permit ip any any log                 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<  a match
  
  

3. A VLAN access-map calls one of the ACLs identified above. Store the VLAN access-map name(s) from step 3 to check in step 4:

vlan access-map BDN-INTRA-VLAN3926-FILTER 1000
  match ip address BDN-LAYER3-DENIED-BY-VACL                       <<< calls the ACL from step 2
  action drop
  
  

4. A VLAN filter calls the VLAN access-map from step 3


vlan filter BDN-INTRA-VLAN3926-FILTER vlan-list 3926            <<< calls the vlan access-map from step 3 against undefined vlan 




If we have all 3 as above we have the unsupported steps of log acl inside a VLAN filter/ VACL and are exposed to this condition.
